# LightbaseCSS
**Lightweight %-based Responsive CSS Template**

Lightbase was created to provide a CSS structure for a very lightweight %-based responsive website. It was created with simplicity and minimalism in mind so that it can act as a plug-n-play template for designers and developers.


**NOTE:** this is OLD (think IE7/8 old). It was created before larger frameworks like Bootstrap/Materialize/Pure/etc were available and provided for a cross-platform grid system that worked in old browsers (IE7+).
